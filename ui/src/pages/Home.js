                                    <h2>Re-thinking The Way We Vote</h2>
                                    <p>In an age where technology has quickly adapted in the most sensitive areas of our lives,
                                        It makes sense to change the way we vote. Anyone could go to the voting site, and in a couple
                                        clicks submit their ballot. Think it's not safe or impossible to guarantee the integrity of elections?
                                        Quite the opposite. Read more in the About page to understand how a system like this would
                                        carry more integrity than the way we currently do things now.

                                    <p>It took one of the largest banks only 5 years to get
                                        80% of its customers to accept online banking.
                                        The positives of such a system outweighed
                                        the negatives. Today, there are procedures in place
                                        for identifying and recovering from fraudulent activity.
                                        Voting on a system that allows unchangable transactions
                                        and allowing anyone to become a validator on the system,
                                        brings accountability and safeguards to those who want to
                                        cheet.

                                    <p>With a system as agile as this, it makes it easy to track discrepencies
                                        and redo an election rather quickly. Using the image processing available
                                        today, it is easy to identify a user using facial recognition against
                                        a valid U.S. ID, and ensuring double dippers are avoided. Being
                                        strategic in cutting back on paper waste also couldn't come at a better
                                        time.
